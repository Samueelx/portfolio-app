# Porfolio App
This is an application that will provide a platform for a professional to manage their online portfolio.

## Description
A portfolio is a professionalâ€™s most important tool. This app attempts to provide a platform for professionals to manage their online portfolios. This is the sinatra backend of the application.

I have three models in this application, `User`, `Project`, and `Skill`. The models are all related to each other.

- `User` - `Project`: This is a one-to-many relationship where an instance of `User` can have many projects(instances of `Project`), but a specific project can only belong to one user.
- `Skill` - `Project`: This is a is a one-to-many relationship where an instance of `Skill` can be used on many projects (instances of `Project`), but a specific project can have zero or one `Skill` (for simplicity).
- `User` - `Skill`: This is a many-to-many relationship where an instance of `User` can have one or more skills and an instance of `Skill` can have one or many users using them.

The Entity-Relationship Diagram below tries to represent these relationships detailed above:
